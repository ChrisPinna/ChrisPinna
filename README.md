## Skills

#### Communication
##### 

In the group projects at Makers, we were given the task of achieving web apps that have the functionality of world-renowned companies Airbnb, Facebook, Twitter, etc and so, the pressure is high.
It‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of trying to produce as many features as possible and forget that this is a learning opportunity.
I made a point of getting to know the people I was working with and for them to know me, of making it known when I didn‚Äôt understand something and asking them to expand on it. I aimed to appearing open so that my team knew that they could disagree if they thought they had a better solution, tell me if they didn‚Äôt understand, ask for help if needed, for them to ùò∏ùò¢ùòØùòµ to talk with me.
As a result, I never had a big problem in my projects, but I had many small ones that were dealt with at the moment.

#### Teamwork
##### 

In our second team project at Makers, we had the chance to improve on our previous experience. The situation was as follows: We had two weeks to learn how to make and deliver a Facebook-like web app with as much functionality as possible; In the previous project, there had been many parts of the project that I had not worked on and I had not learnt from those experiences.
To improve on this I proposed a feature walkthrough, being that our overarching goal was not to make a web app to compete with Facebook and instead to learn from the project, I proposed that after finishing any feature in the project the people in charge of said feature would give a walk-through of how it was achieved.
In the end, this gave us a great chance to improve our communication skills, global awareness of the project, and team-building opportunity (celebrating the achieved feature) and made it much easier for everyone to work on all parts of the project since nothing was completely unfamiliar, in short the real task of learning was achieved whilst having a great Facebook app in our pockets.
